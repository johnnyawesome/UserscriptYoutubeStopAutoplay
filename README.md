# UserscriptYoutubeStopAutoplay

This Userscript stops Youtube From Autoplaying Videos

## What the script does

I find it annoying that, by default, Youtube just keeps playing the next suggestion. Most of the time, those suggestions aren't that good.

This script simply toggles the 'Autoplay' button to 'OFF'.

### __Playlists will still autoplay when using this script.__

Playlists are obviously content that is coherent, so here, autoplay is fine, of course.

## How to run the script

There are several possibilities to run it:
 - The easiest way is to use [TamperMonkey ](https://www.google.ch/search?q=tampermonkey) which is available for [Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and [Chrome ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/tampermonkey), even for [Opera ](https://addons.opera.com/de/search/?query=Tampermonkey)
 ### With Tampermonkey installed,  [click here to immediately install the script! Easy! ðŸ˜‰](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/UserscriptYoutubeStopAutoplay/raw/master/Youtube%20Stop%20Autoplay.user.js)

It's also possible to run it in:
 -  [Greasemonkey in Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
 - It even works from Firefoxes Scratchpad if you don't want to install the Plugin.
