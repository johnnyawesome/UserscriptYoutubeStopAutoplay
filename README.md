# YoutubeStopAutoplay

This Userscript stops YouTube From Autoplaying Videos

## What the script does

By default, YouTube keeps playing the next video in the suggestions. Most of the time, those suggestions aren't very good.

This script simply toggles the 'Autoplay' button to 'OFF' automatically.

### Playlists will still autoplay when using this script.

Playlists are obviously content where Autoplay makes total sense: *The script will not stop Autoplay when you're watching videos from a playlist.*
